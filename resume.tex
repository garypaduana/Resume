\section{Experience}
\subsection{Professional}
\cventry{Nov 2014 \\ Jul 2013}{Senior Software Engineer}{Healthesystems}{Tampa, FL}{}{Created new enterprise integration software and enhanced existing customer-facing products and processes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lead development on a new Spring Integration application that reconciled offline, historical billing transactions with the existing claims adjudication system.
		\item Created a process for integrating new vendors into Healthesystems' payment processing system and worked directly with vendor management and development staff.  Assisted multiple vendors in troubleshooting and design as they developed a client application to interface with the exposed SOAP Web Services.
	\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Apr 2012 \\ Feb 2011}{Senior Software Engineer}{General Dynamics \& Aerotek}{Santa Clara, CA}{}{Implemented server-side computational algorithms to support a resource scheduling system.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Created a utility library used to perform geometric, algebraic, and trigonometric calculations.  One notable component is the computation of the inverse of an $A_{n,n}$ complex matrix using \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition}{{\color{LinkBlue}Lower Upper decomposition}} and permutation matrices.
		\item Implemented the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering}{{\color{LinkBlue}K-Means Clustering}} algorithm to optimize resource allocation.
		\item Created a test driver that analyzed currently scheduled system demand and exercised the entire production system with a high volume of events.
		\item Created an application to bulk load $> 10^{10}$ reference values originating in both text and binary encoding into a relational database using connection pooling and multithreading.
	\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Nov 2010 \\ Sep 2008}{Software Engineer}{Northrop Grumman \& Assured Space}{Redondo Beach, CA}{}{Designed, tested, and integrated custom software to fit the needs of an operational satellite environment  (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Tracking_and_Surveillance_System}{{\color{LinkBlue}STSS}}) through pre-launch, launch, and early-orbit test phases.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Created an application to decode command values from binary receipt files to track changes made to payload memory aboard two satellites as a function of time.
		\item Analyzed communication anomalies and helped to solve a significant operational problem. Created a binary telemetry stream filter to calculate loss rates by looking for malformed data frames.
		\item Wrote a stored procedure to serve time series data to satellite operators with look-behind functionality to identify the last known value just prior to entering the time frame requested for each data series.
		\item Decoded the mission data telemetry stream into subsystem outputs for distribution to specialized analysis teams using an interface control document as reference for bit-level routing.
	\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Feb 2008 \\ May 2006}{IT Security Analyst}{Bayer Corporate and Business Services}{Pittsburgh, PA}{}{Provided IT security services including remote access, account management, and reporting; developed software to automate and refine existing manual processes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Automated a monthly data maintenance task that compiled usage metrics and user account health information for more than 16,000 employees and hundreds of technology services globally.  This new process and software reduced human involvement time from two days to less than four hours.
		\item Provided ad hoc reporting to global management with custom SQL queries.
	\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Personal Projects}
\cventry{Since \\ Jun 2014}{\href{https://github.com/garypaduana/DataGator}{{\color{LinkBlue}DataGator}}}{}{}{}{A Spring Integration utility that transforms the file system into an appliance for common task automation.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item File pollers monitor predefined directories and newly added files are treated as tasks.  
		\item The files can either be *.url links to Internet resources or binary files to be processed directly.
		\item In addition to Java, Python applications are packaged with the deployment artifact and can be referenced at runtime to take greater advantage of existing open source libraries. 
		\item Current functionality includes the ability to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item download \emph{Youtube} video and audio tracks.
			\item encode videos using \emph{HandbrakeCLI} to greatly reduce the file size of uncompressed sources.
			\item rotate videos 90 degrees clockwise to correctly orient the frame losslessly using \emph{ffmpeg}.
			\item re-encode mp3 files using \emph{lame} to lower the file size with a variable bitrate of lower quality.
			\item download jpg, gif, png, and webm files by scraping an HTML document.
			\item select a subset of pages from a pdf document.
			\item rotate each page in a pdf document by 180 degrees.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Since \\ Apr 2014}{\href{https://github.com/garypaduana/BitcoinTaxes}{{\color{LinkBlue}BitcoinTaxes}}}{}{}{}{A Python script to compute crypto-currency capital gains and losses for tax purposes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Uses FIFO accounting and distinguishes between short-term and long-term gains.
		\item A state machine is populated with acquisition data and taxable events (sales) are reviewed in time-based sequence to correctly compute cost basis for each unit of asset sold. 
	\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Since \\ Jun 2010}{\href{https://github.com/garypaduana/GeneralFileUtility}{{\color{LinkBlue}General File Utility}}}{}{}{}{A Groovy desktop application to improve file management productivity.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Duplicate File Finder} - Quickly find duplicate files with a lazily-loaded equals evaluation that fails fast without performing unnecessary IO work whenever possible.  Create hard links for deduplication.
		\item \textit{Smart Merge} - Copy or cut the contents of a folder into a new location ignoring any file deemed to be a duplicate.  Duplicate scope includes the source directory or previously analyzed folders.
		\item \textit{Bulk Rename} - Rename files with a variety of strategies including Trim, Replace, Date-ify, and Series Editor.  Filter affected files with a regular expression and an individual selection capability.
		\item \textit{Binary Operations} - Analyze binary data in hexadecimal form to compute values for a variety of cryptographic message digests, longitudinal parity of various lengths, alternative representations in other numeric bases, and a variety of character set encodings for textual interpretation.
	\end{itemize}

\cventry{Nov 2013 \\ Apr 2013}{Bit Block}{}{}{}{A business directory for Android that aims to connect local businesses and individuals that accept and trade Bitcoin for goods, services, and local currency.  It is a fork of \textit{Block Talk} with new features.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Redefined the REST interface reused from \textit{Block Talk} in favor of JSON over XML to reduce mobile data usage and make automatic map polling much more efficient.  Users have an option to update the map with new information as it is panned, zoomed, and rotated.
		\item Added the current Bitcoin market price as a text overlay on the map and displayed it with a custom color scheme to match the default display style in Google Maps complete with semi-transparent edge stroking to improve readability.  The text is drawn to a Canvas on the MapView with dynamic positioning depending on the device's screen density, physical size, and system font size preference.
